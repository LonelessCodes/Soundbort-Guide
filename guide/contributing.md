# Contributing

Soundbort is an open source project. You can help development, fix bugs and suggest new features. Or you can just ask questions and tell us about bugs.

Soundbort has a staging bot with all new features and bug fixes before they become stable and are added to a new release. You can [add it here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=869715767497740378\&permissions=2150943808\&scope=applications.commands%20bot). You can either just enjoy new features early or - what's really appreciated - help out when you find a bug and tell us about it.
