# First Steps

You've just added Soundbort to your server. What next?

### Playing samples

Just join a voice channel and type `/list`. You will see a list standard samples as **clickable buttons**. Go ahead and press one!

Soundbort should've joined you in your voice channel and played a short audio meme. Try another, this time it will be faster, because it doesn't have to join the voice channel first. You can also make Soundbort join your voice channel without playing anything by typing `/join` and you can make it leave by typing `/leave`.

### Adding your own samples

You like where this is going? Great! Then let's upload some of your own samples!

Type `/upload`, write down a name. Now either click on the "+2 more" and select "audio-file" or hit `TAB` after inputting the name. Grab yourself an audio file you might have laying around and drag it on the drag-and-drop area. _All common audio formats should be supported_. Now just execute the command with `ENTER`.

Alternatively you can upload a file into chat and execute the command afterwards. The file doesn't have to be uploaded by you for Soundbort to use it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware of the current upload limitations. You can view them on the [Limitations ](limitations.md)page.
{% endhint %}

If all went well, Soundboard should tell you it was "successfully added".

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you've encountered problems uploading your sample and Soundbort wasn't of much help resolving those issues, head over to [the Github](https://github.com/lonelesscodes/soundbort) and check for any already existing issues or open [a new issue](https://github.com/lonelesscodes/soundbort/issues).
{% endhint %}

Now you have added your first sample. Click the **"Play" button** to play it back. Type `/list` again to see it pop up in the list.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default `/upload` always adds samples to your personal soundboard. If you're interested in adding samples to your server soundboard, check out the next page [Server Guide](server-guide.md).
{% endhint %}

### Removing samples from your soundboard

If you don't like something about your sample or want to make room for more, you can click the **delete button** below the sample info.

![Sample info with delete button.](<../.gitbook/assets/grafik (24).png>)

Alternatively, if the sample info was deleted or you don't want to find it, you can type `/delete` and provide the name of the sample. The command will give you a list of matching samples that you can delete and in which soundboard they are in.

If all went well, Soundboard should tell you it was removed and from which soundboard.

### Get more soundboard slots

By default each user and server gets 10 slots they can fill with samples. To get more slots, users can upvote the bot on [Top.GG](https://top.gg/bot/868296331234521099/vote) once every 12 hours. On weekends you even get two slots per vote!

You can also get the link to the bot page by typing `/vote`. Those **links are also personalised**, that means other users can click these links to give _YOU_ soundboard slots. When the command is executed in a server, this also includes a link to give the server soundboard slots.
