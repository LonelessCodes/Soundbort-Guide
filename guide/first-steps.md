# First Steps

You've just added Soundbort to your server. What next?

### Playing samples

Just join a voice channel and type `/list`. You will see a list standard samples as clickable buttons. Go ahead and press one!

Soundbort should've joined you in your voice channel and played a short audio meme. Try another, this time it will be faster, because it doesn't have to join the voice channel first. You can also make Soundbort join your voice channel without playing anything by typing `/join` and you can make it leave by typing `/leave`.

### Adding your own samples

You like where this is going? Great! Then let's upload some of your own samples!

Go find yourself an audio file you might have laying around and upload it to a channel in your Discord server. All common audio formats should be supported. Then type `/upload` and give it a name.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware of the current upload limitations. You can view them on the [Limitations ](limitations.md)page.
{% endhint %}

If all went well, Soundboard should tell you it was "successfully added".

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you've encountered problems uploading your sample and Soundbort wasn't of much help resolving those issues, head over to [the Github](https://github.com/lonelesscodes/soundbort) and check for any already existing issues or open [a new issue](https://github.com/lonelesscodes/soundbort/issues).
{% endhint %}

Now you have added your first sample. Click "Play" to play it back. Type `/list` again to see it pop up in the list.

By default `/upload` always adds samples to your personal soundboard. If you're interested in adding samples to your server soundboard, check out the next page [Server Guide](server-guide.md).

### Removing samples from your soundboard

If you don't like something about your sample or want to make room for more, you can type `/delete` and provide the name of the sample.

![Command to remove a sample from your soundboard.](<../.gitbook/assets/grafik (16).png>)

If all went well, Soundboard should tell you it was removed and from which soundboard.
