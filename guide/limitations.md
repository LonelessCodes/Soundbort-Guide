# Limitations

Discord sets some limitations on how large a soundboard can be right now. Then some other limitations must be set by Soundbort to not run out of space too soon and keep providing this service. These are:

| Maximum samples in a soundboard | 10 default (up to 25 by upvoting the bot on [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/868296331234521099)) |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum sample length           | 30 seconds default (longer soon)                                                             |
| Maximum sample file size        | 4 MB default (up to 8 MB later)                                                              |
| Maximum sample name length      | 30 characters                                                                                |

{% hint style="info" %}
These limits are subject to change, but if you have taken advantage of the limits, **you don't need to worry that your samples will be removed**.
